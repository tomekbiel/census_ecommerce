# E-commerce Data Gaps

The following data is not available through public APIs and may require commercial sources:

- **State-level E-commerce**: Not available from public sources. FRED and Census only provide national-level e-commerce data.
- **Micro-industry Breakdowns**: Detailed subcategory data (e.g., specific product categories) is limited in public sources.
- **Real-time Data**: Most public sources have a lag of 1-3 months.
- **Qualitative Metrics**: Metrics like customer satisfaction, cart abandonment rates require commercial sources.
